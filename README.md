## 2025 Fall CTH Introduction to Data Science & AI
Labs of Introduction to Data Science & AI in Chalmers University of Technology

## Lab1-Weather
Be familiar with python library such as numpy, matplotlib, pandas.

## Lab2-Apartments
Know BeautifulSoup to do static website crawler and analyze data from the extracted sources.

## Lab3-Diabetes
1. Build binary Naive Bayse model, train test split function, confusion matrix, evaluation matrix(acc, pre...) by self.
2. Compare the way and result with sklearn libary
3. Analyze the ROC curve and AUC plot

## Lab5-Seeds
1. Build kmeans model(compare to sklearn.kmeans) by self and use Z-score normilization(StandardScaler) for data preprcessing.
2. Use PCA and Gaussian Random Projection to viusalize data in a 2D plot respectively.
3. Calculate rand index to know the similarity between clusters
4. Build linear regression model and analyze the data from the plot.

## Lab6-FashionMNIST
1. Know how to use pytorch and build simple neural network(1 layer), two-layer perceptron and CNN by self.
2. Compare training accuracy, validaion accuracy and test accuracy

## Lab7-Ollma RAG
1. Know how to use lanchain framework with Ollma to do document RAG
